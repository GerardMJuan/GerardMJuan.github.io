title: Revive - Trying to build a writing habit
---

So, a year ago I started this blog. My initial idea was for this blog to act as a hub of sorts for all my research projects, side-projects and random thoughts related to my research, and to learn more about Github, Jekyll and Markdown. I started well, posting some interesting things, and then... nothing. A combination of work, prioritizing other things, and lack of a writing habit made me abandon this project. 

Last month, I was on an interesting international conference (Computed Assisted Radiology and Surgery, [CARS](https://www.cars-int.org)), and when assisting to the various talks there, I thought about how awesome would it be to write something about the conference on my blog after coming back home.

Yeah well, short story, I didn't. 

I found that I lacked the motivation to do it, and when I tried to start writing, the only thing I got was a bland and impersonal summary of the talks. I didn't like what I was writing, I felt like a robot that was just parroting the things that were told in the conference, so I just stopped. But the idea of trying to write again something meaningful in my blog had already started occupying my thoughts again.

This blog has been abandoned for a year now, and I kind of regret not having posted more. At least for me, writing is one of the most difficult things to do during a PhD. I struggle to find the correct words, to try to explain my research in a clear way and with the adequate style, to not procrastinate endlessly. Also, English not being my mother tongue adds an extra layer of complexity to the whole ordeal. Writing is a skill that I need to improve on: to write better, to write faster, to feel more comfortable when doing it. Writing about your own things can be cathartic and liberating. I want to feel in a similar way when writing research! Having a blog like this can also help (slightly) to disseminate your research, to learn to explain you research, to make yourself more organized, and more. It's a shame I haven't written anything for the past year, really.

So, moving on, I would like to start writing more regularly here. I don't really expect anyone to read, but I want to think of it as something for myself first. Something for myself to write in English regularly, to make it a habit. If I'm successful, I expect to be able to write better and more focused during work, too. At least that's the plan.

So, I will write about research projects or subprojects of my PhD, about conferences or talks that I find interesting (Something about CARS, maybe), or any other things that. I want to limit this to just research related stuff, but if I manage to write about things regularly some posts with absurd, minor things (like a Python trick I learned or why the position of the windows in my office makes it impossible to work past 5 PM) are bound to happen. It's okay, I guess. As I said, doubt that many people will be reading. If you are on the other side, hi!

I hope I can keep it up. Time will tell. And if not, I can just try again. Not that big of a deal.
